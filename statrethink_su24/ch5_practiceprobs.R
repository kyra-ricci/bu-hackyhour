## 5E2

# Animal diversity is linearly related to latitude, but only after controlling for plant diversity

# Where 
# Lat = mean latitude
# AD = animal diversity
# PD = plant diversity

# ADi <- a + (bLat * Lat) + (bPD * PD)

## 5E3 

# Neither amount of funding nor size of laboratory by itself id a good predictor of time to PhD degree; but together these variables are both positively associated with time to degree

# Where
# Degree = Time to PhD degree
# Funding = Funding
# Size = Size of lab

# Degree = a + (bFunding * Funding) + (bSize * Size)
# bFunding and bSize should both be positive (???)
